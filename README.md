# Low Level Design Project
### Parking Lot Management System

#### System Architecture Design
##### Developed detailed class and sequence diagrams to clarify interactions and relationships among components like Parking Lot, Parking Space, Booking, and Payment.This ensured precise system architecture.

#### Design Principles and Code Structure
##### - Applied SOLID design principles to enhance code modularity and extensibility.Emphasis was placed on single responsibility and dependency inversion principles to improve maintainability and scalability.

#### Design Patterns Implementation
##### -Implemented key design patterns:
- Factory Method for object creation.
- Strategy pattern for payment processing.
- Observer pattern for real-time updates.

#### Code Optimization and Reuse
- Optimized the code structure, facilitating code reuse across different modules of the parking lot system.

#### System Architecture and Integration
- Designed a resilient system architecture leveraging Java interfaces and abstract classes. This approach facilitated the seamless integration of modular features, resulting in reduced development time and high system uptime.
